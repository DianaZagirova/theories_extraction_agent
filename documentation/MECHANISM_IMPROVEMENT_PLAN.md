# Mechanism Improvement Plan

## ðŸ“Š Current State Analysis

### Results from Stage 4
```
Total theories: 1516
Canonical groups: 39
Novel groups: 0
Unmapped theories: 0

Top 5 Groups:
1. Free Radical Theory: 290 theories (3 mechanisms, 12 key players)
2. Disposable Soma Theory: 217 theories (5 mechanisms, 17 key players)
3. Antagonistic Pleiotropy Theory: 190 theories (4 mechanisms, 15 key players)
4. Mitochondrial Decline Theory: 174 theories (4 mechanisms, 13 key players)
5. Oxidative Stress Theory: 130 theories (4 mechanisms, 14 key players)
```

### ðŸš¨ Problems Identified

#### 1. **Over-Mapping to Canonical Theories**
- **Issue**: Stage 1.5 mapped 1499/1516 theories (98.9%) to canonical
- **Problem**: Too aggressive mapping - many papers likely discuss specific aspects but get mapped to broad theories
- **Example**: A paper about "mitochondrial ROS in neurons" â†’ mapped to "Free Radical Theory"

#### 2. **Generic Canonical Mechanisms**
- **Issue**: Canonical mechanisms are too broad
- **Example**: Free Radical Theory mechanisms:
  ```
  - "ROS generated as byproducts of aerobic metabolism"
  - "Oxidative damage to DNA, proteins, lipids"
  - "Accumulated damage impairs cellular function"
  ```
- **Problem**: These apply to 290 different papers, losing specificity

#### 3. **No Paper-Specific Context**
- **Issue**: All theories in a group share identical canonical mechanisms
- **Problem**: Can't distinguish between:
  - Paper about ROS in brain aging
  - Paper about ROS in muscle aging
  - Paper about ROS in caloric restriction

#### 4. **Missing Granularity**
- **Issue**: Large groups (290, 217, 190 theories) are too coarse
- **Problem**: Can't identify sub-theories or variations within canonical theories

## ðŸŽ¯ Improvement Strategies

### **Strategy 1: Add Paper-Specific Mechanism Extraction**

#### Current Flow
```

    Returns:
        Enhanced metadata with both canonical and paper-specific mechanisms
    """
    
    # Build prompt
    prompt = f"""Extract PAPER-SPECIFIC details for this theory.

CANONICAL THEORY: {canonical_data['name']}

CANONICAL MECHANISMS (for reference):
{chr(10).join([f'- {m}' for m in canonical_data['mechanisms']])}

        'source': 'hybrid'  # Both canonical and paper-specific
    }
```

### **Strategy 2: Sub-Group Clustering**

#### Concept
After grouping by canonical name, cluster papers within each group by paper-specific mechanisms.

#### Implementation

**Add to Stage 4:**
```python
def create_subgroups(self, canonical_group: TheoryGroup, theories: List[Dict]) -> List[TheoryGroup]:
    """
    Create sub-groups within a canonical group based on paper-specific mechanisms.
    
    Args:

        theories: All theories in this group
        
    Returns:
        List of sub-groups
    """
    
    # Extract paper-specific signatures
    paper_sigs = []
    for theory in theories:
        metadata = theory.get('stage3_metadata', {})
        sig = {
            'theory': theory,
            'specific_mechanisms': set(metadata.get('paper_specific_mechanisms', [])),
            'specific_players': set(metadata.get('paper_specific_key_players', [])),
            'context': metadata.get('context', {})
        }
        paper_sigs.append(sig)
    
    # Cluster by similarity
    subgroups = []
    while paper_sigs:
        seed = paper_sigs.pop(0)
        cluster = [seed]
        
        remaining = []
        for sig in paper_sigs:
            # Calculate similarity based on paper-specific details
            similarity = self._calculate_paper_similarity(seed, sig)
            if similarity >= 0.5:  # Threshold
                cluster.append(sig)
            else:
                remaining.append(sig)
        
        paper_sigs = remaining
        
        # Create subgroup
        subgroup = TheoryGroup(
            group_id=f"{canonical_group.group_id}_SUB{len(subgroups)+1}",
            canonical_name=canonical_group.canonical_name,
            representative_name=f"{canonical_group.canonical_name} - {get_cluster_label(cluster)}",
            theory_ids=[s['theory']['theory_id'] for s in cluster],
            theory_count=len(cluster),
            # ... other fields
        )
        subgroups.append(subgroup)
    
    return subgroups
```

**Example Output:**
```
Free Radical Theory (290 theories) â†’
  - Free Radical Theory - Mitochondrial ROS in Brain (45 theories)
  - Free Radical Theory - Oxidative Stress in Muscle (38 theories)
  - Free Radical Theory - ROS and Caloric Restriction (52 theories)
  - Free Radical Theory - Antioxidant Defense (31 theories)
  - ...
```

---

### **Strategy 3: Hierarchical Mechanism Structure**

#### Concept
Organize mechanisms in a hierarchy: General â†’ Specific â†’ Paper-specific

#### Structure
```json
{
  "mechanisms": {
    "level_1_canonical": [
      "ROS generated as byproducts of aerobic metabolism"
    ],
    "level_2_specific": [
      "Mitochondrial Complex I produces superoxide",
      "Complex III generates ROS at Qi site"
    ],
    "level_3_paper": [
      "Complex I ROS production increases 2-fold in aged rat brain mitochondria",
      "Caloric restriction reduces Complex I ROS by 40% in skeletal muscle"
    ]
  },
  "context_tags": [
    "tissue:brain",
    "tissue:muscle",
    "condition:aging",
    "condition:caloric_restriction",
    "species:rat"
  ]
}
```

---

### **Strategy 4: Improve Stage 1.5 Mapping Criteria**

#### Current Issue
Stage 1.5 is too aggressive - maps 98.9% of theories to canonical.

#### Improvements

**1. Stricter Mapping Threshold**
```python
# Current
if mapping_confidence >= 0.7:
    mapped_theories.append(theory)

# Improved
if mapping_confidence >= 0.85:  # Higher threshold
    mapped_theories.append(theory)
```

**2. Add "Partial Match" Category**
```python
if mapping_confidence >= 0.85:
    # Strong match - use canonical mechanisms
    category = 'canonical_match'
elif mapping_confidence >= 0.6:
    # Partial match - extract paper-specific mechanisms
    category = 'partial_match'
else:
    # Novel or unmatched
    category = 'novel'
```

**3. Update Prompt to Be More Conservative**
```
When mapping, be CONSERVATIVE:
- Only map if the paper's CORE MECHANISM matches the canonical theory
- If the paper discusses a SPECIFIC ASPECT or APPLICATION, mark as partial match
- If the paper proposes a NEW MECHANISM, mark as novel

Examples:
- "ROS in aging" â†’ Free Radical Theory (canonical match)
- "ROS in brain aging via SIRT1" â†’ Free Radical Theory (partial match - extract specifics)
- "Novel epigenetic clock based on DNA methylation" â†’ Novel (new mechanism)
```

---

### **Strategy 5: Add Mechanism Enrichment Tags**

#### Concept
Tag mechanisms with metadata for better filtering and grouping.

#### Implementation
```python
{
  "mechanism": "Mitochondrial ROS production increases with age",
  "tags": {
    "level": "molecular",
    "tissue": "brain",
    "species": "rat",
    "intervention": "caloric_restriction",
    "direction": "increase",
    "quantified": true,
    "value": "2-fold increase"
  }
}
```

#### Benefits
- Filter by tissue: "Show all brain aging mechanisms"
- Filter by intervention: "Show all caloric restriction mechanisms"
- Compare quantified effects: "Which interventions reduce ROS most?"

## ðŸ’¡ Quick Start: Phase 1 Implementation

### 1. Update Stage 1.5 Mapping Threshold

**File**: `src/normalization/stage1_5_llm_mapping.py`

**Change**:
```python
# Line ~390
# OLD:
if result.is_mapped and result.canonical_name:
    mapped_theories.append(theory_with_result)

# NEW:
if result.is_mapped and result.canonical_name and result.mapping_confidence >= 0.85:
    mapped_theories.append(theory_with_result)
elif result.is_mapped and result.canonical_name and result.mapping_confidence >= 0.6:
    # Partial match - needs paper-specific extraction
    theory_with_result['mapping_type'] = 'partial'
    mapped_theories.append(theory_with_result)
```

### 2. Update Prompt

**File**: `src/normalization/stage1_5_llm_mapping.py`

**Add to prompt** (line ~145):
```
# MAPPING CRITERIA

Be CONSERVATIVE when mapping:
- **CANONICAL MATCH** (confidence >= 0.85): Paper's core mechanism matches canonical theory
- **PARTIAL MATCH** (confidence 0.6-0.84): Paper discusses specific aspect/application
- **NOVEL** (confidence < 0.6): Paper proposes fundamentally new mechanism

Examples:
âœ“ "Oxidative stress causes aging" â†’ Oxidative Stress Theory (0.95)
âœ“ "ROS in hippocampal aging" â†’ Free Radical Theory (0.75 - partial)
âœ— "Novel epigenetic aging clock" â†’ Novel (0.3)
```

### 3. Test

```bash
python src/normalization/stage1_5_llm_mapping.py \
  --input output/stage1_fuzzy_matched.json \
  --output output/stage1_5_llm_mapped_STRICT.json \
  --batch-size 30

# Check distribution
python -c "
import json
with open('output/stage1_5_llm_mapped_STRICT.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
    print(f'Mapped: {len(data[\"mapped_theories\"])}')
    print(f'Novel: {len(data[\"novel_theories\"])}')
    print(f'Unmatched: {len(data[\"still_unmatched\"])}')
    
    # Check confidence distribution
    confidences = [t['stage1_5_result']['mapping_confidence'] 
                   for t in data['mapped_theories']]
    import statistics
    print(f'Avg confidence: {statistics.mean(confidences):.2f}')
"
```

## ðŸš€ Recommendation

**Start with Phase 1** (stricter mapping) - this is the quickest way to improve results with minimal code changes. This will:
1. Reduce over-mapping to canonical theories
2. Increase novel theory discovery
3. Create better balance in group sizes

Then evaluate if Phase 2 and 3 are needed based on the results.
