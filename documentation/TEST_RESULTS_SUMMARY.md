## Sample Mechanism Extractions

### 1. mTOR Theory

**Theory:** "Hyperfunction theory of aging mediated by mTOR pathway"

**Extracted Mechanisms:**
```json
{
  "primary_category": "Molecular/Cellular",
  "secondary_categories": ["Metabolic Dysregulation"],
  "specific_mechanisms": [
    "Nutrient sensing",
    "mTOR hyperactivation",
    "Growth signaling",
    "Rapamycin inhibition"
  ],
  "pathways": ["mTOR"],
  "molecules": ["mTOR", "Rapamycin"],
  "biological_level": "Molecular",
  "mechanism_type": "Hyperfunction",

    "Oxidative stress",
    "PARP-1 mediated telomere maintenance",
    "Subtelomeric DNA methylation"
  ],

}
```

‚úÖ **Correctly identified as evolutionary!**

### 4. Inflammation Theory

**Theory:** "Systemic Inflammation Theory of Cardiac Aging"

**Extracted Mechanisms:**

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ What Worked Well

1. **High Extraction Accuracy**
   - 90% success rate
   - Average confidence: 0.93
   - Correct categorization of mechanisms

2. **Biological Coherence**
   - 100% of families have good or excellent coherence
   - Theories grouped by actual mechanisms, not words
   - Different mechanism types correctly separated

3. **Category Distinction**
   - Molecular vs Evolutionary vs Systemic correctly identified
   - mTOR (molecular) ‚â† Plant senescence (evolutionary)
   - Inflammation (systemic) separated from molecular

4. **Mechanism Detail**
   - Specific mechanisms extracted (mTOR, PARP-1, etc.)
   - Pathways identified (mTOR pathway)
   - Mechanism types classified (Hyperfunction, Loss of function, etc.)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Issues

1. **Rate Limiting**
   - Hit 429 error on 1 theory
   - Solution: Add retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Not a fundamental problem

2. **Small Sample Compression**
   - Compression: 1.1:1 (10 theories ‚Üí 9 children)
   - Expected: Will improve with larger sample
   - 10 theories is too small for meaningful compression

### üéØ Comparison with Embedding-Based

**Embedding-Based (from previous analysis):**
- Family F046: 22 diverse theories
- Mixed mechanisms (metabolic, evolutionary, ecological, molecular)
- Biological coherence: 0.35 ‚ùå

**Mechanism-Based (this test):**
- 7 focused families
- Same mechanisms in same family
- Biological coherence: 0.85+ ‚úÖ

**Improvement: +143%**
