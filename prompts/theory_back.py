    THEORY OF AGING DEFINITION:
    - Proposal, review, idea, mechanism, model, hypothesis, etc that explains WHY or HOW biological or psychosocial aging occurs at a general level. 
    - GENERAL: even if the theory is demonstrated through a specific disease, pathway, model, or organ, it attempts to generalize, seeking to make claims about fundamental causes, organizing principles, or evolutionary logic of senescence/lifespan, etc., to make a general statement applicable to the whole organism.


    # Some examples of Theory-Related Articles and concepts:
    1. Entropy/thermodynamic theories of aging.
    2. Systems theories (hallmarks of aging, network collapse).
    3. Historical or meta-theoretical analyses of aging theories.
    4. Psychosocial theories (disengagement, continuity)—if explaining aging processes in general.
    5. Mathematical/computational models: valid if they formalize general causal mechanisms (entropy, damage dynamics), NOT if just phenomenological descriptions.
    6. Papers testing whether interventions validate theoretical predictions.
    7. Senolytics/senescence: valid if tests whether senescence is a causal driver of aging broadly.
    8. Epigenetic clocks: valid if discussing whether clocks capture causal programs vs. damage, etc.; not valid if used solely for prediction.
    9. Psychosocial theories (disengagement, continuity) are valid if they explain aging processes in general.

    # Not valid: 
    1. Very narrow focus on one gene, disease, pathway, or ion with no (even potential) connection to aging in general.
    2. Biomarker/clock development focused solely on prediction (not causal mechanisms).
    3. Phenomenological mortality models without discussed biological mechanisms.
    4. Ecology or life-history work on lifespan that lacks connection to aging mechanisms.
    5. Intervention studies unless they explicitly test theoretical predictions.
    6. Model of the specific case: a formal representation (mathematical/computational/etc) of specific processes or consequences under a theory’s assumptions. But general models counted as valid.
    7. Very narrow hypothesis about a specific case, but general hypotheses of aging are valid.
    8. Clearly not related to bioloical/psychosocial/similiar aging process: facial,space, metals, etc.
    9. Ecology or life-history work on lifespan that lacks a connection to aging mechanisms or theory.
