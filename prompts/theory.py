AGING THEORY CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA
## Definition
In this case, an "aging theory" is a proposal, model, hypothesis, or mechanism that explains **WHY or HOW biological or psychosocial aging occurs** at a general, organism-level scale.

## Core Requirements (ALL must be met)

1. **Generalizability**: The theory must attempt to explain aging as a fundamental process, not just describe a narrow phenomenon
   - Even if demonstrated in a specific disease, pathway, organ, or model system
   - Must propose underlying causes, organizing principles, or evolutionary logic
   - Should make claims applicable to the organism as a whole

2. **Causal explanation**: Must propose mechanisms or reasons for aging, not just describe patterns or correlations

3. **Scope**: Addresses aging broadly, not limited to:
   - Single organs/tissues (unless connected to general aging)
   - Specific diseases (unless framed as testing general theory)
   - Purely predictive tools without mechanistic claims

## VALID Examples (Theory-Related)

### Biological theories:
- Programmed aging theories (genetic/epigenetic programs)
- Damage accumulation theories (free radicals, DNA damage, protein aggregation)
- Evolutionary theories (antagonistic pleiotropy, disposable soma)
- Cellular senescence as a causal driver of systemic aging  
- Mathematical/computational models of general causal mechanisms (entropy, damage dynamics)
- Epigenetic clocks when discussing causal mechanisms (e.g., whether clocks reflect programmed aging vs. damage)

### Psychosocial theories:
- Disengagement theory, continuity theory, or many other frameworks explaining general psychosocial aging processes

### Intervention/empirical studies:
- Studies explicitly testing theoretical predictions (e.g., "Does removing senescent cells validate the senescence theory?")
- Senolytics research when framed as testing senescence as a causal mechanism

### Organ-specific research:
- Valid only if clearly connected to general aging mechanisms (e.g., vascular aging as a driver of systemic aging)

## INVALID Examples (NOT Theory-Related)

1. Purely predictive models     
   - Biomarkers/clocks focused solely on age prediction without mechanistic discussion
   - Phenomenological mortality models with no biological mechanism proposed

2. Narrow or applied research
   - Disease-specific studies without connection to general aging
   - Organ-specific research not linked to broader aging theory
   - Intervention studies without explicit theoretical framework

3. Descriptive models of specific cases
   - Mathematical models of specific processes under a theory (implementation details)
   - Exception: General models that formalize broad principles ARE valid

4. Unrelated topics
   - Facial aging (cosmetic)
   - Space aging (environmental/occupational)
   - Metal toxicity studies (unless framed as general aging mechanism)
   - Methodological papers without theoretical content

5. Psychosocial frameworks without general mechanisms
   - Individual adaptation, resilience, or motivation studies
   - Coping strategies or quality-of-life research without broader aging theory
