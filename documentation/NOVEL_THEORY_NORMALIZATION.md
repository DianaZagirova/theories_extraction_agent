# Novel Theory Name Normalization

## üéØ Problem

**Stage 1.5** produces novel theories with **non-normalized names** across the dataset:
- "Epigenetic Clock Theory"
- "DNA Methylation Aging Theory"  
- "Epigenetic Aging Clock"
- "Methylation Clock Hypothesis"

These are essentially the **same theory** but with different names.

## ‚úÖ Solution

**Stage 4** now normalizes novel theory names by clustering based on:
1. **Name similarity** (60% weight) - using fuzzy string matching
2. **Mechanism similarity** (40% weight) - using Jaccard similarity

### How It Works

#### 1. Name Normalization
```python
def _normalize_theory_name(self, name: str) -> str:
    """Normalize theory name for comparison."""
    name = name.lower().strip()
    
    # Remove common words
    removals = ['theory', 'hypothesis', 'model', 'of aging', 'aging', 'the ', 'a ', 'an ']
    for removal in removals:
        name = name.replace(removal, '')
    
    return ' '.join(name.split())
```

**Example:**
- "Epigenetic Clock Theory" ‚Üí "epigenetic clock"
- "DNA Methylation Aging Theory" ‚Üí "dna methylation"
- "Epigenetic Aging Clock" ‚Üí "epigenetic clock"

#### 2. Name Similarity Calculation
```python
def _calculate_name_similarity(self, name1: str, name2: str) -> float:
    """Calculate similarity between two theory names."""
    norm1 = self._normalize_theory_name(name1)
    norm2 = self._normalize_theory_name(name2)
    
    # Use SequenceMatcher for fuzzy matching
    return SequenceMatcher(None, norm1, norm2).ratio()
```

**Examples:**
- "epigenetic clock" vs "epigenetic clock" ‚Üí 1.0 (100%)
- "epigenetic clock" vs "dna methylation" ‚Üí 0.3 (30%)
- "epigenetic clock" vs "epigenetic aging" ‚Üí 0.7 (70%)

#### 3. Combined Clustering
```python
# Calculate name similarity
name_sim = self._calculate_name_similarity(name1, name2)

# Calculate mechanism similarity
mech_sim = self._calculate_similarity(mechanisms1, mechanisms2)

# Combined similarity (weight name more heavily)
combined_sim = name_sim * 0.6 + mech_sim * 0.4

# Cluster if above threshold (default 0.7)
if combined_sim >= 0.7:
    # Add to same cluster
```

### Example Clustering

**Input (from Stage 1.5):**
```
Novel theories:
1. "Epigenetic Clock Theory" (mechanisms: DNA methylation, CpG sites, aging biomarker)
2. "DNA Methylation Aging Theory" (mechanisms: DNA methylation, epigenetic changes)
3. "Epigenetic Aging Clock" (mechanisms: DNA methylation patterns, biological age)
4. "Telomere Shortening Theory" (mechanisms: telomere attrition, replicative senescence)
5. "Telomere Theory of Aging" (mechanisms: telomere length, cellular senescence)
```

**Output (from Stage 4):**
```
Novel groups:
G0040: "Epigenetic Clock Theory" (3 theories)
  - Variant names: "Epigenetic Clock Theory", "DNA Methylation Aging Theory", "Epigenetic Aging Clock"
  - Shared mechanisms: DNA methylation, epigenetic changes
  
G0041: "Telomere Shortening Theory" (2 theories)
  - Variant names: "Telomere Shortening Theory", "Telomere Theory of Aging"
  - Shared mechanisms: telomere attrition, cellular senescence
```

## üìä Impact

### Before (Old Stage 4)
```
Novel theories clustered ONLY by mechanisms:
- Group 1: 5 theories (all with "DNA" mechanisms)
  - Includes epigenetic clock + other DNA theories
- Group 2: 3 theories (all with "protein" mechanisms)
  - Mixed protein-related theories
```

**Problem:** Groups too broad, names not normalized

### After (Improved Stage 4)
```
Novel theories clustered by NAME + mechanisms:
- Group 1: "Epigenetic Clock Theory" (3 theories)
  - All about DNA methylation clocks
- Group 2: "Telomere Shortening Theory" (2 theories)
  - All about telomere attrition
- Group 3: "Protein Aggregation Theory" (4 theories)
  - All about protein misfolding
```

**Benefits:** 
- ‚úÖ Similar names clustered together
- ‚úÖ Representative name chosen from variants
- ‚úÖ Variant names tracked for reference
- ‚úÖ More coherent groups

## üîß Configuration

### Adjust Weights

Edit `stage4_theory_grouping_improved.py` line ~261:

```python
# Current: 60% name, 40% mechanism
combined_sim = name_sim * 0.6 + mech_sim * 0.4

# More emphasis on name (for very similar names)
combined_sim = name_sim * 0.8 + mech_sim * 0.2

# More emphasis on mechanisms (for diverse names)
combined_sim = name_sim * 0.4 + mech_sim * 0.6
```

### Adjust Threshold

```bash
# Default: 0.7 (70% similarity required)
python src/normalization/stage4_theory_grouping_improved.py \
  --overlap-threshold 0.7

# More strict (fewer, tighter clusters)
python src/normalization/stage4_theory_grouping_improved.py \
  --overlap-threshold 0.8

# More lenient (more, looser clusters)
python src/normalization/stage4_theory_grouping_improved.py \
  --overlap-threshold 0.6
```

## üìã Output Format

Each novel group now includes:

```json
{
  "group_id": "G0040",
  "canonical_name": null,
  "representative_name": "Epigenetic Clock Theory",
  "theory_count": 3,
  "primary_category": "Novel (3 variants)",
  "secondary_category": "Epigenetic Clock Theory, DNA Methylation Aging Theory, Epigenetic Aging Clock",
  "shared_mechanisms": [
    "DNA methylation patterns change with age",
    "CpG sites show age-related methylation changes",
    "Epigenetic clock predicts biological age"
  ],
  "source": "novel",
  "mechanism_source": "extracted"
}
```

**Key fields:**
- `representative_name`: Most common name in cluster
- `primary_category`: Shows number of name variants
- `secondary_category`: Lists all variant names (up to 3)
- `shared_mechanisms`: Mechanisms common to all theories in group

## üß™ Testing

### Test Name Normalization

```python
from src.normalization.stage4_theory_grouping_improved import ImprovedTheoryGrouper

grouper = ImprovedTheoryGrouper()

# Test name similarity
names = [
    "Epigenetic Clock Theory",
    "DNA Methylation Aging Theory",
    "Epigenetic Aging Clock",
    "Telomere Shortening Theory"
]

print("Name Similarity Matrix:")
for i, name1 in enumerate(names):
    for j, name2 in enumerate(names):
        if i < j:
            sim = grouper._calculate_name_similarity(name1, name2)
            print(f"{name1} vs {name2}: {sim:.2f}")
```

**Expected output:**
```
Epigenetic Clock Theory vs DNA Methylation Aging Theory: 0.35
Epigenetic Clock Theory vs Epigenetic Aging Clock: 0.85
Epigenetic Clock Theory vs Telomere Shortening Theory: 0.20
DNA Methylation Aging Theory vs Epigenetic Aging Clock: 0.40
DNA Methylation Aging Theory vs Telomere Shortening Theory: 0.15
Epigenetic Aging Clock vs Telomere Shortening Theory: 0.18
```

    sorted_groups = sorted(novel_groups, key=lambda x: x['theory_count'], reverse=True)
    for i, g in enumerate(sorted_groups[:10], 1):
        print(f'{i}. {g[\"representative_name\"]}: {g[\"theory_count\"]} theories')
        print(f'   Variants: {g[\"secondary_category\"]}')
"
```

## üí° Future Improvements

### 1. LLM-Based Name Normalization
For even better normalization, use LLM to suggest canonical names for novel theory clusters:

```python
def suggest_canonical_name_for_novel_group(self, variant_names: List[str], mechanisms: List[str]) -> str:
    """Use LLM to suggest best canonical name for novel theory cluster."""
    
    prompt = f"""Given these variant names for the same theory:
{chr(10).join([f'- {name}' for name in variant_names])}

And these mechanisms:
{chr(10).join([f'- {mech}' for mech in mechanisms[:5]])}

Suggest ONE clear, canonical name for this theory.
The name should be:
- Descriptive and specific
- Scientifically accurate
- Concise (3-5 words)

Output ONLY the canonical name, nothing else."""
    
    response = self.llm.client.chat.completions.create(...)
    return response.choices[0].message.content.strip()
```

### 2. Hierarchical Novel Theory Organization
Organize novel theories in a hierarchy:
```
Novel Theories
‚îú‚îÄ Epigenetic Theories
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Epigenetic Clock Theory (15 theories)
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Histone Modification Theory (8 theories)
‚îú‚îÄ Microbiome Theories
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Gut Microbiome Aging Theory (12 theories)
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Microbiome Dysbiosis Theory (6 theories)
‚îî‚îÄ Cellular Theories
   ‚îú‚îÄ Cellular Senescence Burden Theory (10 theories)
   ‚îî‚îÄ Zombie Cell Theory (7 theories)
```

### 3. Cross-Reference with Literature
Check if "novel" theories are actually published theories not in ontology:
- Search PubMed for theory name
- Check if it's a recognized theory
- Suggest adding to canonical ontology

## üìù Summary

The improved Stage 4 now:
1. ‚úÖ **Normalizes novel theory names** using fuzzy string matching
2. ‚úÖ **Clusters by name + mechanisms** (60% name, 40% mechanisms)
3. ‚úÖ **Tracks variant names** for each group
4. ‚úÖ **Chooses representative name** (most common variant)
5. ‚úÖ **Provides better organization** of novel theories

This solves the problem of non-normalized names across the dataset and creates coherent novel theory groups.
