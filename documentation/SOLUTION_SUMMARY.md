# Theory Normalization: Executive Summary

## Problem Statement
Normalize ~14,000 aging theory names (with duplicates and variations) into ~300-350 canonical theories while:
1. **Removing false positives** (low confidence theories)
2. **Preserving fine-grained distinctions** (similar keywords, different mechanisms)
3. **Creating parent-child hierarchy** (generic → specific theories)
4. **Maintaining scientific accuracy**

---

## Current State Analysis

### Data Statistics
- **Current:** 2,608 theories from 2,100 papers
- **Expected final:** ~14,000 theories
- **Confidence distribution:**
  - High: 77.7% (~10,883 theories) ✓ Keep
  - Medium: 21.5% (~3,011 theories) → Re-validate with LLM
  - Low: 0.7% (~104 theories) ✗ Remove (false positives)

### Key Challenges Identified

**Challenge 1: False Positives**
- Even "high confidence" may include edge cases
- Need validation mechanism beyond initial extraction

**Challenge 2: Similar but Different**
- 53 mitochondrial-related theories exist
- Example: "CB1 receptor-mediated mitochondrial quality control" vs "p53-mediated mitochondrial stress response"
- **These must remain separate** - different mechanisms

**Challenge 3: Parent-Child Structure**
- Generic: "Mitochondrial Theory of Aging" (parent)
- Specific: "Cisd2-mediated mitochondrial protection theory" (child)
- Need to identify and preserve this hierarchy

**Challenge 4: Scale**
- 14K theories requires efficient processing
- Cannot do pairwise LLM comparisons (14K × 14K = 196M comparisons)

## Recommended Solution: Hybrid Multi-Stage Pipeline

### Architecture

```
Input: 14,000 raw theories
    ↓
Stage 0: Quality Filtering
    • Remove low confidence (104 theories)
    • LLM re-validate medium confidence (keep ~2,400)
    • Result: ~13,300 validated theories
    ↓
Stage 1: Multi-Dimensional Embedding
    • Name-only embedding (broad similarity)
    • Semantic embedding (name + concepts)
    • Detailed embedding (full context)
    • Concept features (mechanisms, pathways, molecules)
    ↓
Stage 2: Three-Level Hierarchical Clustering
    • Level 1: 30-50 theory families (e.g., "Mitochondrial Theories")
    • Level 2: 150-200 parent theories (e.g., "Mitochondrial Dysfunction Theory")
    • Level 3: 300-350 child theories (e.g., "Cisd2-mediated mitochondrial protection")
    ↓
Stage 3: LLM Validation & Distinction
    • Verify cluster coherence
    • Check for over-clustering (preserve distinctions)
    • Identify parent-child relationships
    • Generate canonical names
    ↓
Stage 4: Ontology Integration
    • Match to initial_ontology.json (known theories)
    • Identify novel theories
    • Cross-validate
    ↓
Stage 5: Quality Assurance
    • Review singletons (unclustered theories)
    • Validate boundary cases
    • Human review of flagged cases
    ↓
Output: 300-350 normalized theories with hierarchy
```

## Key Innovation: Fine-Grained Distinction Preservation

### Problem
Traditional clustering would merge:
- "CB1 receptor-mediated mitochondrial quality control"
- "p53-mediated mitochondrial stress response"

Both mention "mitochondrial" → same cluster ✗ WRONG

### Solution
**Multi-dimensional similarity scoring:**

```python
similarity = (
    0.4 × semantic_similarity(embeddings)      # Overall concept
    + 0.3 × concept_overlap(key_concepts)      # Shared concepts
    + 0.3 × mechanism_distinction(features)    # Different mechanisms
)

# Mechanism distinction REDUCES similarity if different
# "CB1 receptor" vs "p53" → high distinction → lower similarity → separate clusters
```

**LLM validation explicitly checks:**
```
"Do these theories describe the EXACT SAME mechanism?
If NO, identify distinct sub-groups based on:
- Different molecular mechanisms (CB1 vs p53)
- Different pathways (mTOR vs AMPK)
- Different processes (autophagy vs apoptosis)

IMPORTANT: Preserve meaningful mechanistic distinctions."
```

## Why This Approach Works

### ✓ Addresses All Requirements

**1. False Positive Removal**
- Stage 0: Filter low confidence
- Stage 0: LLM re-validate medium confidence
- Stage 5: Singleton review catches outliers

**2. Fine-Grained Distinction Preservation**
- Multi-dimensional embeddings capture nuances
- Concept features flag different mechanisms
- LLM validation prevents over-clustering
- Conservative distance thresholds at Level 3

**3. Parent-Child Hierarchy**
- Three-level clustering naturally creates hierarchy
- LLM identifies generic vs specific theories
- Flexible structure based on actual data

**4. Scalability**
- Embeddings: O(n) - linear time
- Hierarchical clustering: O(n²) but on subsets
- LLM validation: Only 350 clusters, not 14K theories
- Total: ~7 days single-threaded, 3-4 days parallelized

### ✓ Cost-Effective

**Total cost: ~$27**
- Embeddings: $0.20
- LLM validation: $26.50

Compare to:
- Pure LLM pairwise: $500+ and 1 week runtime
- Manual curation: Weeks of expert time

### ✓ High Accuracy

**Expected metrics:**
- Clustering accuracy: >90%
- False positive removal: >85%
- Fine-grained preservation: >95%
- Coverage: >95% theories successfully normalized
