GH activity modulates lifespan and age-related metabolic health: Elevated GH activity is associated with shortened lifespan, increased metabolic dysfunction, and cancer incidence, whereas reduced GH activity (via GH deficiency or resistance) extends lifespan and protects against age-related metabolic disorders. | GH influences age-related lipid redistribution and adipose tissue function: Aging leads to redistribution of lipid from extra-peritoneal to intra-peritoneal white adipose tissue (WAT) depots, contributing to metabolic dysfunction. Reduced GH action preserves extra-peritoneal WAT and prevents hepatic triglyceride accumulation, suggesting GH drives detrimental lipid redistribution during aging. | GH activity promotes accumulation of senescent cells in WAT: Senescent progenitor cells accumulate in WAT with age, contributing to tissue dysfunction via pro-inflammatory SASP. GH-deficient and GH-resistant mice show reduced senescent cell burden in WAT, while GH-overexpressing or GH-injected mice show increased senescent cell accumulation, linking GH signaling to cellular senescence in adipose tissue. | GH impairs preadipocyte differentiation with aging: Chronic GH exposure inhibits preadipocyte differentiation capacity in aging, mediated by downregulation of adipogenic transcription factors PPAR\u03b3 and C/EBP\u03b1. Reduced GH action preserves adipogenesis in aged mice, potentially maintaining healthy WAT function. | GH effects on WAT senescence may be direct or indirect via IGF-1, insulin, glucose, and mTOR: GH alters circulating IGF-1, insulin, and glucose levels, all of which modulate mTOR activity, a key driver of geroconversion and cellular senescence.
