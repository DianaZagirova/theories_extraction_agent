# Robust Mechanism-Based Clustering: Ensuring Consistency

## The Problem You Identified ⚠️

**Current approach is too simplistic:**

```
Theory A → LLM says "Nutrient sensing"
Theory B → LLM says "Nutrients sensing"  
Theory C → LLM says "Nutritional sensing"
Theory D → LLM says "Nutrient-sensing pathways"

→ 4 different categories for the SAME concept! ❌
```

**This breaks clustering:**
- Same mechanism gets split into multiple families
- Inconsistent across runs
- No guarantee of reproducibility

## Solution: Multi-Stage Controlled Extraction

### Architecture Overview

```
Stage 1: Build Controlled Vocabulary (one-time)
  ↓
Stage 2: Extract with Controlled Vocabulary
  ↓
Stage 3: Normalize & Validate
  ↓
Stage 4: Cluster with Canonical Terms
```

---

## Stage 1: Build Controlled Vocabulary (One-Time)

### Step 1.1: Define Canonical Taxonomy

**Create a predefined ontology of aging mechanisms:**

```json
{
  "primary_categories": {
    "Molecular_Cellular": {
      "canonical_name": "Molecular/Cellular",
      "aliases": ["molecular", "cellular", "molecular-cellular"],
      "description": "Theories about molecular or cellular mechanisms"
    },
    "Evolutionary": {
      "canonical_name": "Evolutionary",
      "aliases": ["evolution", "evolutionary biology"],
      "description": "Theories about evolutionary origins of aging"
    },
    "Systemic": {
      "canonical_name": "Systemic",
      "aliases": ["system-level", "organismal"],
      "description": "Theories about system-level changes"
    }
  },
  
  "secondary_categories": {
    "DNA_Damage": {
      "canonical_name": "DNA Damage",
      "parent": "Molecular_Cellular",
      "aliases": ["DNA damage", "genomic damage", "genetic damage"],
      "subcategories": ["Telomere_Shortening", "Oxidative_DNA_Damage", "Mutation_Accumulation"]
    },
    "Metabolic_Dysregulation": {
      "canonical_name": "Metabolic Dysregulation",
      "parent": "Molecular_Cellular",
      "aliases": ["metabolic dysfunction", "metabolism dysregulation"],
      "subcategories": ["Nutrient_Sensing", "Autophagy", "Mitochondrial_Biogenesis"]
    }
  },
  
  "specific_mechanisms": {
    "Nutrient_Sensing": {
      "canonical_name": "Nutrient Sensing",
      "parent": "Metabolic_Dysregulation",
      "aliases": [
        "nutrient sensing",
        "nutrients sensing",
        "nutritional sensing",
        "nutrient-sensing pathways",
        "nutrient detection",
        "nutrient response"
      ],
      "pathways": ["mTOR", "AMPK", "Sirtuins", "Insulin_IGF1"],
      "description": "Cellular mechanisms that detect and respond to nutrient availability"
    },
    "mTOR_Pathway": {
      "canonical_name": "mTOR Pathway",
      "parent": "Nutrient_Sensing",
      "aliases": [
        "mTOR",
        "mTOR signaling",
        "mTOR pathway",
        "TOR pathway",
        "Target of Rapamycin",
        "mechanistic target of rapamycin"
      ],
      "molecules": ["mTOR", "S6K", "4E-BP1", "Rapamycin"],
      "description": "Nutrient-sensing pathway regulating growth and metabolism"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 1.2: Use LLM to Build Vocabulary from Sample

**Instead of hardcoding, use LLM to generate it:**

```python
def build_controlled_vocabulary(sample_theories, llm_client):
    """
    Use LLM to analyze sample theories and build canonical vocabulary.
    This is done ONCE, then reused for all theories.
    """
    
    # Step 1: Extract all mechanisms from sample (free-form)
    all_mechanisms = []
    for theory in sample_theories:
        mechanisms = llm_extract_freeform(theory, llm_client)
        all_mechanisms.append(mechanisms)
    
    # Step 2: Ask LLM to cluster similar terms
    prompt = f"""
    You are building a canonical vocabulary for aging mechanisms.
    
    Here are mechanisms extracted from {len(sample_theories)} theories:
    {json.dumps(all_mechanisms, indent=2)}
    
    Task: Group similar/synonymous terms and create canonical names.
    
    For example:
    - "nutrient sensing", "nutrients sensing", "nutritional sensing" 
      → Canonical: "Nutrient Sensing"
    
    - "mTOR", "TOR pathway", "mechanistic target of rapamycin"
      → Canonical: "mTOR Pathway"
    
    Output a controlled vocabulary with:
    1. Canonical name (the standard term to use)
    2. Aliases (all variations that mean the same thing)
    3. Parent category
    4. Description
    
    Output as JSON.
    """
    
    vocabulary = llm_client.generate_response(prompt)
    
    # Step 3: Validate and save
    save_vocabulary(vocabulary, 'output/controlled_vocabulary.json')
    
    return vocabulary
```

---

## Stage 2: Extract with Controlled Vocabulary

### Step 2.1: Constrained LLM Extraction

**Force LLM to use ONLY terms from vocabulary:**

```python
CONSTRAINED_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
You are an expert in aging biology. Extract mechanisms from this theory.

Theory: {theory_name}
Description: {theory_description}

IMPORTANT: You MUST use ONLY the terms from this controlled vocabulary:

PRIMARY CATEGORIES (choose ONE):
{primary_categories_list}

SECONDARY CATEGORIES (choose 1-3):
{secondary_categories_list}

SPECIFIC MECHANISMS (choose 2-5):
{specific_mechanisms_list}

PATHWAYS (if mentioned):
{pathways_list}

MOLECULES (if mentioned):
{molecules_list}

Rules:
1. Use EXACT terms from the lists above
2. Do NOT invent new terms
3. If a concept is not in the list, choose the closest match
4. If truly novel, mark as "Novel_Mechanism" and explain

Output as JSON:
{{
  "primary_category": "...",  // MUST be from PRIMARY CATEGORIES list
  "secondary_categories": ["..."],  // MUST be from SECONDARY CATEGORIES list
  "specific_mechanisms": ["..."],  // MUST be from SPECIFIC MECHANISMS list
  "pathways": ["..."],
  "molecules": ["..."],
  "novel_mechanisms": [  // Only if truly novel
    {{
      "suggested_name": "...",
      "reason": "...",
      "closest_existing": "..."
    }}
  ]
}}
"""

def extract_with_vocabulary(theory, vocabulary, llm_client):
    """Extract mechanisms using controlled vocabulary."""
    
    # Format vocabulary as lists for prompt
    primary_list = "\n".join([
        f"- {cat['canonical_name']}: {cat['description']}"
        for cat in vocabulary['primary_categories'].values()
    ])
    
    secondary_list = "\n".join([
        f"- {cat['canonical_name']}: {cat['description']}"
        for cat in vocabulary['secondary_categories'].values()
    ])
    
    # ... similar for mechanisms, pathways, molecules
    
    prompt = CONSTRAINED_EXTRACTION_PROMPT.format(
        theory_name=theory['name'],
        theory_description=theory['description'],
        primary_categories_list=primary_list,
        secondary_categories_list=secondary_list,
        specific_mechanisms_list=mechanisms_list,
        pathways_list=pathways_list,
        molecules_list=molecules_list
    )
    
    response = llm_client.generate_response(prompt)
    
    return response
```

### Step 2.2: Fuzzy Matching Fallback

**If LLM still uses variant terms, normalize them:**

```python
from fuzzywuzzy import fuzz
from fuzzywuzzy import process

def normalize_term(term, vocabulary_category, threshold=85):
    """
    Normalize a term to its canonical form using fuzzy matching.
    
    Args:
        term: The term to normalize (e.g., "nutrients sensing")
        vocabulary_category: Dict of canonical terms with aliases
        threshold: Minimum similarity score (0-100)
    
    Returns:
        Canonical term or None if no match
    """
    
    # Build list of all valid terms (canonical + aliases)
    valid_terms = {}
    for key, data in vocabulary_category.items():
        canonical = data['canonical_name']
        valid_terms[canonical] = canonical
        for alias in data.get('aliases', []):
            valid_terms[alias.lower()] = canonical
    
    # Exact match first
    if term.lower() in valid_terms:
        return valid_terms[term.lower()]
    
    # Fuzzy match
    best_match, score = process.extractOne(
        term.lower(), 
        valid_terms.keys(),
        scorer=fuzz.ratio
    )
    
    if score >= threshold:
        return valid_terms[best_match]
    
    # No match - flag for review
    return None

def normalize_extraction(raw_extraction, vocabulary):
    """Normalize all extracted terms to canonical forms."""
    
    normalized = {
        'primary_category': normalize_term(
            raw_extraction['primary_category'],
            vocabulary['primary_categories']
        ),
        'secondary_categories': [
            normalize_term(cat, vocabulary['secondary_categories'])
            for cat in raw_extraction['secondary_categories']
        ],
        'specific_mechanisms': [
            normalize_term(mech, vocabulary['specific_mechanisms'])
            for mech in raw_extraction['specific_mechanisms']
        ],
        # ... similar for pathways, molecules
    }
    
    # Remove None values (terms that couldn't be normalized)
    normalized = {
        k: [v for v in vals if v is not None] if isinstance(vals, list) else vals
        for k, vals in normalized.items()
    }
    
    return normalized
```

---

## Stage 3: Validation & Consistency Checks

### Step 3.1: Cross-Validation

**Use multiple LLM calls to ensure consistency:**

```python
def validate_extraction_consistency(theory, vocabulary, llm_client, n_runs=3):
    """
    Extract mechanisms multiple times and check for consistency.
    """
    
    extractions = []
    for i in range(n_runs):
        extraction = extract_with_vocabulary(theory, vocabulary, llm_client)
        normalized = normalize_extraction(extraction, vocabulary)
        extractions.append(normalized)
    
    # Check consistency
    consistency_score = calculate_consistency(extractions)
    
    if consistency_score < 0.8:
        # Low consistency - flag for manual review
        return {
            'extraction': extractions[0],  # Use first one
            'consistency_score': consistency_score,
            'needs_review': True,
            'all_extractions': extractions
        }
    else:
        # High consistency - use majority vote
        return {
            'extraction': majority_vote(extractions),
            'consistency_score': consistency_score,
            'needs_review': False
        }

def calculate_consistency(extractions):
    """Calculate how consistent multiple extractions are."""
    
    # Check if primary category is same
    primary_consistency = len(set(
        e['primary_category'] for e in extractions
    )) == 1
    
    # Check overlap in secondary categories
    all_secondary = [set(e['secondary_categories']) for e in extractions]
    secondary_overlap = len(set.intersection(*all_secondary)) / len(set.union(*all_secondary))
    
    # Check overlap in mechanisms
    all_mechanisms = [set(e['specific_mechanisms']) for e in extractions]
    mechanism_overlap = len(set.intersection(*all_mechanisms)) / len(set.union(*all_mechanisms))
    
    # Weighted average
    consistency = (
        0.5 * (1.0 if primary_consistency else 0.0) +
        0.3 * secondary_overlap +
        0.2 * mechanism_overlap
    )
    
    return consistency
```

### Step 3.2: Hierarchical Validation

**Ensure extracted terms follow hierarchy:**

```python
def validate_hierarchy(extraction, vocabulary):
    """
    Ensure extracted terms are hierarchically consistent.
    
    Example: If mechanism is "mTOR Pathway", 
    then secondary must be "Metabolic Dysregulation"
    and primary must be "Molecular/Cellular"
    """
    
    errors = []
    
    # Check each mechanism has correct parent
    for mechanism in extraction['specific_mechanisms']:
        mech_data = vocabulary['specific_mechanisms'].get(mechanism)
        if not mech_data:
            errors.append(f"Unknown mechanism: {mechanism}")
            continue
        
        expected_parent = mech_data['parent']
        if expected_parent not in extraction['secondary_categories']:
            errors.append(
                f"Mechanism '{mechanism}' requires parent '{expected_parent}' "
                f"but got {extraction['secondary_categories']}"
            )
    
    # Check each secondary has correct primary
    for secondary in extraction['secondary_categories']:
        sec_data = vocabulary['secondary_categories'].get(secondary)
        if not sec_data:
            errors.append(f"Unknown secondary: {secondary}")
            continue
        
        expected_primary = sec_data['parent']
        if extraction['primary_category'] != expected_primary:
            errors.append(
                f"Secondary '{secondary}' requires primary '{expected_primary}' "
                f"but got {extraction['primary_category']}"
            )
    
    return {
        'is_valid': len(errors) == 0,
        'errors': errors
    }
```

---

## Stage 4: Enhanced Clustering with Canonical Terms

### Step 4.1: Deterministic Clustering

**Since all terms are now canonical, clustering is deterministic:**

```python
def cluster_by_canonical_terms(theories, extractions, vocabulary):
    """
    Cluster theories using canonical terms.
    Guaranteed to be consistent across runs.
    """
    
    # Group by secondary category (families)
    families = defaultdict(list)
    
    for theory, extraction in zip(theories, extractions):
        # Use canonical term as key
        for secondary in extraction['secondary_categories']:
            families[secondary].append(theory['theory_id'])
    
    # Group by specific mechanism (parents)
    parents = defaultdict(list)
    
    for theory, extraction in zip(theories, extractions):
        for mechanism in extraction['specific_mechanisms']:
            parents[mechanism].append(theory['theory_id'])
    
    # Group by pathway (children)
    children = defaultdict(list)
    
    for theory, extraction in zip(theories, extractions):
        for pathway in extraction.get('pathways', []):
            children[pathway].append(theory['theory_id'])
    
    return families, parents, children
```

### Step 4.2: Reproducibility Guarantee

**Hash-based verification:**

```python
import hashlib
import json

def generate_clustering_hash(theories, extractions):
    """
    Generate a hash of the clustering to verify reproducibility.
    """
    
    # Sort everything for deterministic hashing
    sorted_data = {
        'theories': sorted([t['theory_id'] for t in theories]),
        'extractions': sorted([
            {
                'theory_id': e['theory_id'],
                'primary': e['primary_category'],
                'secondary': sorted(e['secondary_categories']),
                'mechanisms': sorted(e['specific_mechanisms'])
            }
            for e in extractions
        ], key=lambda x: x['theory_id'])
    }
    
    # Generate hash
    data_str = json.dumps(sorted_data, sort_keys=True)
    hash_value = hashlib.sha256(data_str.encode()).hexdigest()
    
    return hash_value

def verify_reproducibility(run1_hash, run2_hash):
    """Verify two runs produced identical results."""
    return run1_hash == run2_hash
```

## Advanced: Iterative Vocabulary Refinement

### Step 5.1: Detect Novel Mechanisms

```python
def detect_novel_mechanisms(all_extractions, vocabulary):
    """
    Identify mechanisms that appear frequently but aren't in vocabulary.
    """
    
    novel_mechanisms = defaultdict(int)
    
    for extraction in all_extractions:
        for novel in extraction.get('novel_mechanisms', []):
            novel_mechanisms[novel['suggested_name']] += 1
    
    # If a novel mechanism appears >5 times, add to vocabulary
    frequent_novel = {
        name: count 
        for name, count in novel_mechanisms.items() 
        if count >= 5
    }
    
    return frequent_novel
```

### Step 5.2: LLM-Assisted Vocabulary Expansion

```python
def expand_vocabulary(novel_mechanisms, vocabulary, llm_client):
    """
    Use LLM to decide if novel mechanisms should be added to vocabulary.
    """
    
    prompt = f"""
    Current vocabulary has these mechanisms:
    {list(vocabulary['specific_mechanisms'].keys())}
    
    Novel mechanisms detected:
    {list(novel_mechanisms.keys())}
    
    For each novel mechanism:
    1. Is it truly distinct from existing mechanisms?
    2. Should it be added as a new canonical term?
    3. Or is it an alias of an existing term?
    
    Output as JSON:
    {{
      "novel_mechanism_name": {{
        "action": "add_new" | "add_alias" | "ignore",
        "canonical_name": "...",
        "parent_category": "...",
        "reason": "..."
      }}
    }}
    """
    
    decisions = llm_client.generate_response(prompt)
    
    # Update vocabulary based on decisions
    updated_vocabulary = apply_vocabulary_updates(vocabulary, decisions)
    
    return updated_vocabulary

---

## Recommendation

### For 761 Theories: Use Robust Approach

**Why:**
- Ensures consistency
- Production-ready
- Worth the extra complexity

**Implementation:**
1. Build vocabulary from 100-theory sample (30 min)
2. Extract with controlled vocabulary (10 min)
3. Validate and normalize (5 min)
4. Cluster deterministically (1 min)

**Total: ~1 hour, but guaranteed consistent results**

### For 14K Theories: Robust is ESSENTIAL

**Why:**
- Too large for manual fixes
- Must be reproducible
- Vocabulary will evolve

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Implement controlled vocabulary builder
2. ✅ Add fuzzy matching normalization
3. ✅ Add consistency validation
4. ✅ Add hierarchy validation
5. ✅ Test on sample
6. ✅ Deploy to production

**This ensures production-grade consistency! 🚀**
