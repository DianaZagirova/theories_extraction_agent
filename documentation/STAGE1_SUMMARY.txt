STAGE 1: FUZZY MATCHING - IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
================================================================================

## Overview
Stage 1 performs intelligent fuzzy matching of theory names to known theories 
from the ontology BEFORE LLM involvement. This significantly reduces LLM costs 
and processing time.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Aggressive Name Normalization
- Removes common suffixes: "theory", "hypothesis", "model", "aging", etc.
- Handles smart quotes (U+2019) and regular apostrophes
- Removes possessives ('s)
- Example: "Oxidative Stress Hypothesis of Aging" → "oxidative stress"

### 2. Abbreviation Matching (NEW)
- Extracts abbreviations from theory names: (ABBR) or [ABBR]
- Matches against abbreviations defined in ontology
- Examples:
  * "Dysdifferentiation Hypothesis of Aging and Cancer (DHAC)" → Dysdifferentiation Theory
  * "Mitochondrial Free Radical Theory of Aging (MFRTA)" → Mitochondrial Decline Theory
  * "Membrane Hypothesis of Aging (MHA)" → Membrane Theory

### 3. Multi-Level Matching Strategy
1. **Abbreviation matching** - Check for (ABBR) patterns first
2. **Exact matching** - Normalized name exact match
3. **High confidence fuzzy matching** - Score >= 90 with validation
4. **Compound name validation** - Prevents false matches on variants

### 4. Comprehensive Alias Support
- Loads all aliases from ontology
- Maps variations to canonical names
- Example: "Harman's Theory" → "Free Radical Theory"

## Results on Real Data (7,675 theories)

### Match Statistics:
- Abbreviation matches: 115 (1.5%)
- Exact matches: 1,330 (17.3%)
- High confidence fuzzy: 24 (0.3%)
- **Total matched: 1,469 (19.1%)**
- Remaining for LLM: 6,206 (80.9%)

### Top Matched Theories:
1. Free Radical Theory - 262 theories
2. Disposable Soma Theory - 202 theories
3. Antagonistic Pleiotropy Theory - 182 theories
4. Mitochondrial Decline Theory - 132 theories
5. Oxidative Stress Theory - 122 theories

## Files Generated:
1. `output/stage0_filtered_theories.json` - Quality filtered theories
2. `output/stage1_fuzzy_matched.json` - Matched/unmatched theories (JSON)
3. `output/stage1_matching_report.txt` - Human-readable report

## Next Steps:
- Use `unmatched_theories` from stage1_fuzzy_matched.json for LLM processing
- LLM only needs to process 6,206 theories instead of 7,675
- **Cost savings: ~19% reduction in LLM calls**

## Configuration:
- Exact threshold: 100
- High confidence threshold: 90
- Min token overlap: 0.8
- Ontology: ontology/groups_ontology_alliases.json (46 canonical theories, 161 aliases, 12 abbreviations)
